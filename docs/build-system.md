# Build and platform selection

`cargo nxrs` is the host-only Rust build controller in `platform/build`. It owns
profile resolution, SDK preparation, Cargo invocation, NuttX configuration and
linking, artifact checks, signing and offline factory packaging. Its dependencies
are build dependencies; they do not enter firmware.

```sh
cargo nxrs platforms
cargo nxrs apps
cargo nxrs build --app home-cam --platform wroom
cargo nxrs build --app event-demo --platform cores3
cargo nxrs build --app std-demo --platform macos
cargo nxrs build --app event-demo --profile pico2-mock --dry-run
```

The seven platform families are:

| Platform | Hardware / environment | Default profile |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wroom` | ESP32-S3 WROOM / Freenove N16R8, NuttX | `esp32s3-camera-stream-startup` |
| `cores3` | M5Stack CoreS3, NuttX | `m5stack-cores3-gnss` |
| `pico2w` | Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W / RP2350, NuttX | `pico2w-radio` |
| `linux` | Native Linux | `linux` |
| `macos` | Native macOS | `macos` |
| `windows` | Native Windows | `windows` |
| `web` | Browser, `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` | `web` |

`--profile` selects an explicit product or qualification configuration. With
`--platform`, it must belong to that family. Qualification profiles such as
`pico2-mock` and `mps2-an521-mock` are configurations, not additional public
platform families. Native builds target the current host OS.

Platform admission does not imply every HAL is implemented or physically
qualified. CoreS3 sensor wiring still needs physical qualification. Windows has
file-camera, storage, IP transport and detector bindings. Web currently builds
the Emscripten thread qualification; hardware HALs are unbound. Stock
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` does not provide these std threads.

## Configuration and ownership

Applications keep only entry facts in Cargo metadata: binary, command, priority
and stack size. App/service source and manifests stay platform-free. Declarative
profiles under `platform/profiles` and `platform/nuttx/platforms` select hardware
resources, capabilities, execution/model budgets and OS build settings. HAL
implementations stay in their owning HAL crates.

The CLI and HAL build scripts share one Rust profile resolver. Model dependency
features follow the profile automatically. There is no shell environment-file
interpreter or Python platform resolver. Existing qualification entry scripts
are compatibility adapters; numerical reference/oracle tests remain independent.

Upstream NuttX Make/Kconfig/configure scripts, compilers, CMake and the pinned
`imgtool`/Espressif SDK remain external tools. Python remains a prerequisite for
those vendor tools and independent qualification tests. Compiler installation
and experimental compiler/OS research harnesses remain separate setup/test work.

## Inputs and outputs

Prepare the pinned sources explicitly; Cargo build scripts do not fetch:

```sh
cargo nxrs fetch tls
cargo nxrs fetch detector
```

NuttX needs its existing qualified toolchains. Rust discovers the pinned Xtensa
bundle beneath `target/qemu-tools` (or `NXRS_QEMU_TOOLS_DIR`) directly. Explicit
native-board setups can supply their compiler paths and SDK as before. A private
SDK copy receives checked patches; the installed SDK is not modified. The final
build checks the actual std source, device libc ABI, ELF, symbols and Kconfig.

Signed profiles retain the existing required inputs:
`NXRS_FIRMWARE_SIGNING_KEY`, `NXRS_FIRMWARE_VERIFY_KEY`,
`NXRS_FIRMWARE_VERSION` and `NXRS_FIRMWARE_SECURITY_COUNTER`. Packaging verifies
against the independently supplied public root before publishing an image.
Build/package commands do not flash, provision or program eFuses.

Default output is `target/build/<binary>/<profile>/`; `--out` overrides it.
An ownership marker prevents reuse of unrelated output directories. Empty
folders and regular log-only folders can be adopted for qualification drivers.
Rebuilds clear old success evidence. Provider/profile hashes, SDK patch records,
ABI/source checks and final image hashes accompany NuttX artifacts.

Use `--manifest-path` and optional `--bin` for qualification binaries. The Web
builder accepts an optional `--html` template containing one `__NXRS_SCRIPT__`
marker and publishes its verified JS/WASM pair under `site/`.
